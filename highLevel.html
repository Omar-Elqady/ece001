        <h1>High Level</h1>
        <p >“High-level” programming languages take their name from the relatively high level, or degree of abstraction, of the features they provide, relative to those of the assembly languages they were originally designed to replace. The adjective “abstract,” in this context, refers to the degree to which language features are separated from the details of any particular computer architecture. The early development of languages like Fortran, Algol, and Lisp was driven by a pair of complementary goals: machine independence and ease of programming. By abstracting the language away from the hardware, designers not only made it possible to write programs that would run well on a wide variety of machines, but also made the programs easier for human beings to understand.Programmers write in high-level languages because they are easier to understand and are less complex than machine code. They allow the programmer to focus on what needs to be done, rather than on how the computer actually works.
